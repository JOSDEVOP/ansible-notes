###  WHAT IS ANSIBLE
- Ansible is an open-source automation tool that helps manage and automate tasks across multiple computers. Think of it like a remote control for your computer systems. With Ansible, you can set up configurations, deploy applications, and manage systems from one central location.

- Ansible works by connecting to your computers over the network and executing commands on them. It doesn't require any special software to be installed on the computers you're managing, just a way to connect to them, like SSH for Linux systems.

- It's widely used in IT for tasks like automating server setups, managing cloud services, and orchestrating complex workflows. The best part is that it's simple to use, thanks to its human-readable language called YAML, which you use to write instructions for what you want Ansible to do.
- Ansible is Agentless meaning  you dont need to install other apps on the managed nodes to configure them
